      <h1>Evin Tolentino - IS 5315 Sec. #3</h1>
      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>"Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Today’s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation." - https://www.docker.com/what-docker</p>
      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>"NGINX is the heart of the modern web, powering half of the world’s busiest sites and applications. The NGINX open source project started in 2002 and has grown exponentially over the past 10+ years, thanks to the vision of Igor Sysoev and the enthusiasm and support of our loyal community of users. Today, millions of innovators choose NGINX and NGINX Plus for delivering their sites and applications with performance, reliability, security, and scale." - https://www.nginx.com/company/</p>
      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>"A virtual machine is a software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications. The virtual machine is comprised of a set of specification and configuration files and is backed by the physical resources of a host. Every virtual machine has virtual devices that provide the same functionality as physical hardware and have additional benefits in terms of portability, manageability, and security. A virtual machine consists of several types of files that you store on a supported storage device. The key files that make up a virtual machine are the configuration file, virtual disk file, NVRAM setting file, and the log file. You configure virtual machine settings through the vSphere Web Client or the vSphere Client. You do not need to touch the key files.A virtual machine can have more files if one or more snapshots exist or if you add Raw Device Mappings (RDMs)." - https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-50/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc_50%2FGUID-CEFF6D89-8C19-4143-8C26-4B6D6734D2CB.html</p>
      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean provides the easiest cloud platform to deploy, manage, and scale applications of any size, removing infrastructure friction and providing predictability so developers and their teams can spend more time building better software. - https://www.digitalocean.com/help/</p>
